## Appendix A – Background Information

* The overall aim of this project is to develop a report that can determine the overall performance of the company. This report will bring together data from a core set of performance indicators, into a single analysis.
* The organisation has recently experienced a decline in its profit margin, despite a huge increase to their marketing budget. The boards aim is to understand the root cause of this decline and make an informed decision around their future spend on marketing campaigns.
* The business has been witnessing a quarterly 20% sales increase, which enabled them to introduce new products every other month.
* The incremental pattern in sales and expansion has declined drastically over recent months and the board believe that by identifying the products generating fewer sales, would allow for a marketing programme to be developed leading to an increase in sales.
* This initial piece of work will lead to a more detailed application of data analytics across specific business areas and / or to the implementation of targeted marketing actions and new product development.
* This report will help to encourage the board that intelligent and creative use of data analysis can give the organisation an advantage. It will also help them to understand the marketing strategy for each product, whilst considering the time of year at which sales are highest.
* Your manager would like to understand the relationships between customer purchases, product categories and revenue, to enable more sales, an increase in revenue per sale and to improve the quantity of products purchased per sale.
* They want to understand the role that the time of year plays to a customer, as this insight would likely improve sales significantly.
* The key challenge facing the board is that decisions will need to be made regarding upcoming, coinciding marketing campaigns and if these should be postponed temporarily or permanently.
